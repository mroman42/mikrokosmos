    "## The λ-calculus\n",
    "\n",
    "The [**λ-calculus**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda_calculus) (or *lambda calculus*) is a logical formal system which is also a model of computation (like Turing machines). It was introduced in the 1930s by Alonzo Church, who was looking for a formal system able to  express the notion of computability. It is Turing-complete, that is, it has the property that every computable function can be written on λ-calculus.\n",
    "\n",
    "It syntax is very simple; any expression is either:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - a **variable**, which could have appeared firstly on the lambda \n",
    "    abstraction;\n",
    "    \n",
    "  - a **lambda abstraction** $\\lambda x. -$, which can be interpreted \n",
    "    as a function taking $x$ as an argument and outputting what is\n",
    "    written under $-$, which can depend on $x$;\n",
    "    \n",
    "  - or an **application** of two expressions $(\\lambda x. M)N$ which \n",
    "    applies the function $(\\lambda x. M)$ over the argument $N$.\n",
    "    When a function is applied, all the ocurrences of $x$ on $M$ will \n",
    "    be substituted by $N$. This is what is called **$\\beta$-reduction**;\n",
    "    and captures the notion of function application.\n",
    "\n",
    "I.e. any function $f$ can be written as $(\\lambda x.f(x))$, and it can be applied to an argument as\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ (\\lambda x.f(x))\\ y \\longrightarrow f(y). $$\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the function that duplicates an element could be written as $(\\lambda x.\\ 2 \\cdot x)$, and it would be applied to $3$ as\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ (\\lambda x.\\ 2 \\cdot x)\\ 3 \\longrightarrow 2 \\cdot 3 \\longrightarrow 6.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter, however, we will restrict ourselves to very basic functions which do not involve arithmetic. How to define natural numbers, addition or multiplication will be topics for future chapters.\n",
    "\n",
    "## A first example\n",
    "\n",
    "In Mikrokosmos, it is possible to use the backslash character as a λ to make the input easier. If you happen to have a greek keyboard configured, however, feel free to write \"λ\"! Mikrokosmos accepts both sintaxes. For example, the nested expression $\\lambda x.(\\lambda y.x)$ can be written as `\\x.(\\y.x)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our first example defines a very simple lambda term, the **identity function** $\\lambda x. x$; which is a function that takes an argument $x$ and returns it unchanged. Our first statement just after this definition will be apply this function to itself. Keep in mind during this tutorial that it is perfectly possible to apply functions to other functions or to themselves; in fact, this is one of the core ideas of lambda calculus."
